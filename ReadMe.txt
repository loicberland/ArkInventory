Issues:
	* there is a bug where the window size isn't being calculated for some reason on the first time around, closing the window and re-opening seems to fix it for the remainder of the session.
	* the background can appear in front of the items rendering them unuseable - note this is not an ai code problem, it would appear to be an issue with blizzards CreateFrame api function.  a workaround for this issue is included in the addon but will spam warnings to your chat window, you can disble them by entering /ai misc alert disable.


Bugs:
	* guild bank (vault) can have display issues on first open, just change tabs or refresh
	
	
To Do:
	* bar growth direction, vertical or horizontal
	* some way to show slot type when theres an item in it (like coloured borders but it can't screw up the existing rarity border colouring)
	* add tooltips when over a frame that shows what categories are in the frame
